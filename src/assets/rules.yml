        Whenever a player takes the Oathkeeper title, the title flips to its Oathkeeper side if it is not already on that side. Being the Oathkeeper adds to various victory goals (`rule:3`). The Oathkeeper must add one defense die in Campaign as defender (`rule:5.5.2`), and the Usurper must add two.

              - Any sites they rule. _(Yes, anywhere on the map!)_
              - Any of their relics and banners if their pawn is at your site. _(A banner adds defense dice equal to the number of favor or secrets on it.)_
              - Their pawn and favor if their pawn is at your site. _(This adds two dice, as shown by the shield on their board.)_
              
            You must declare at least one target at your site. If the defender rules your site, you must target your site. The attacker adds attack dice to their **attack pool** up to the number of warbands on their board.

The Law supersedes the Playbook and play aids _(players' boards, Campaign Summary, etc.)_ except for the Site Reference.

        The following information is private: the card fronts of cards in all discard piles, the number of cards in the world deck, the card backs of cards in the world deck beyond the first card, and the card fronts of any facedown cards. A player who holds a facedown adviser can peek at it and allow any other player to peek at it. Players may discuss and may lie about the identity of private information. 
        <br>
        All other information is public. _(This includes the card backs and number of cards in discard piles, and the numbers of favor, secrets, and warbands on boards. No, you cannot switch facedown advisers under the table or otherwise mix up which is which.)_
