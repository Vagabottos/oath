  questions:
    - q: Which pieces are buildings? Which are tokens?
      a: Broadly, square cardboard pieces that go in slots are buildings, while circular cardboard pieces are tokens. You’ll find detailed lists of buildings and tokens on the back of the learn-to-play and the backs of the faction boards.
      laws: 
        - "2.5"

      laws: 
        - "4.3.1"

    - q: Do the Favor... cards really remove all enemy pieces from those clearings?
      a: Yes. Every single one—except the Vagabond, of course. What a sneaky guy. However, Ruins and the items beneath them are not removed! Lucky Vagabond.
      laws: 
        - "2.1"

    - q: Do the Favor... cards score victory points?

        - "2.5"

        - "8.2.5"

      laws:
        - "2.5"

    - q: What does "activating" a piece for crafting mean? Do I do anything with it?
      a: Nope. Activating just means "I have it, and I want to use it for crafting." You don't need to get rid of it or do anything other than point at it and say, "I'm activating this to craft a card."
      laws:
        - "4.1.1"

    - q: Are Ruins placed even if there is no Vagabond in the game?

      laws:
        - "7.7"

      laws:
        - "7.7"

- category: Woodland Alliance
  color: "#68b653"

      laws:
        - "8.4.1"

    - q: Can I revolt in the clearing with the keep token?
      a: Nope! You would have to place a sympathy token first, which you can’t do because of the Marquise’s special ability The Keep.

- category: Vagabond
  color: "#6d6e70"
  questions:
    - q: Can I craft cards with multiple-suit requirements?

        - "9.2.1"

    - q: Do I trigger the Alliance's Outrage when I move into a sympathetic clearing?

      laws:
        - "9.8.1"
        
    - q: Can the Alliance organize to place a sympathy token in the clearing with the Marquise Keep?
